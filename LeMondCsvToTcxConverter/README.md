Usage Instructions
------------------
1. Use the "Add File..." button to Add all the files that should be combined into a sinlge .tcx file (some of the LeMond trainers will only do 99 minutes at a time, so if you want to ride longer than 99 minutes you end up with multiple files)
2. Click the "Create Tcx..." button to save the csv files as .tcx file (you will be prompted for the name and location)
3. Use the "Upload a file on your computer" option in strava to upload your newly created .tcx file
